Web Crawler (for fun) under Python 3

Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------

This is a repository for basic (or simple) web crawlers under Python 3, initially for Chinese users (as I am) because it was, at first, mainly used to deal with websites in China and we are in the 'WALL' (if you know that)(because of which I'm not confident if I can use a crawler successfully though I have got a cheap VPN). It may include applications to other websites in the future as I'm going to start my graduate study in US, so crawlers for various websites are warmly welcomed. I'll check them when I have the accessibility to them.

You will be able to find articles or blogs related to these codes as I'll either upload them to this repository or give the link to them in this README, also in the future. Everytime I update something I'll also write it in this README, as follows. Please feel free to check that!

Finally, this repository is under the MIT License. Hope you like it!
